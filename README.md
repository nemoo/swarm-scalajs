ScalaJs flocking simulation
==============

This is a simulation of flocking behaviour, written in ScalaJs.

It is inspired by [this blog post](http://harry.me/blog/2011/02/17/neat-algorithms-flocking/) and based on Li Haoyi's excellent [scalajs workbench exmaple app](https://github.com/lihaoyi/workbench-example-app).

+ to start, run `activator ~fastOptJS`
